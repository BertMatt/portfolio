            My name is Mattia Bertoldi, I'm curious about everything technology and I created this page to collect projects that I created or that I want to work on.
            I often have ideas, so I just decided to start turning things into reality lately when I discovered my interest for software and I've started applying that interest in small hobbies.
            I'm a curious person in general, and as you'll be able to see from my bookshelf page, I like to deep dive into the most various concepts. If you are reading this, you might be interested in knowing more about me,
            so here's a quick breakdown.

            As I said, I'm curious. I've always been interested in the most random topics and that doesn't just show when I come up with random fun facts about the history of bananas trade, but also in my education.
            I studied languages in high school, then moved to Business Administration and Finance in my Bachelor's. While in university, I developed a big interest in technology, specifically in the Financial sector and the
            software developments of Blockchain and Decentralized Finance. I studied the industry and the technology behind, and I figured that I've always just been interested in technology itself. That's when I decided to take the
            CS50x course, offered for free by Harvard University online, and that way I constructed my basic understanding of computer science. From there, I was accepted at LMU Munich at the MMT program, which combines management practices with
            various informatics topics, specifically, I got interested in AI because of its great potential. So I studied its basics, in a wonderful course held by Prof. Bjorn Ommer, one of the main heads behind Stable Diffusion. That fed my interest
            and taught me a lot, also because I don't come from a computer science background so I found it particularly challenging.

            This approach though is something that has always accompanied me throughout my life, I'm not scared of challenges, I seek to be the dumbest one in the room, and I want to learn from people that have more knowledge and experience than me, if possible, the best in the field.
            This is the same mindset that pushed me to go on an exchange semester in Australia, at the University of Melbourne. That was a wonderful experience, I fell in love with Australia and I felt grateful to be able to experience teaching at one of the most
            prestigious universities in the world. And even there, I took up challenges. I decided to enrol in one of the most demanding computer science courses offered by the university to learn more about Cluster and Cloud Computing, and I built a more complex understanding of the physical and technical
            layers of the internet in another course about Internet Technologies. Alongside that, I followed one of the most stimulating courses I've ever had, the sustainable business practices course, that gave me an important perspective about the state of our world and the path forward to
            develop sustainably.

            This is a small summary of my path so far, now I'm at a stage in which I want to build and this website will be my repository for that, feel free to roam around and take a look wherever you want.
