                    <div class="book-review">I put my hands on this book because i believe it is extremely powerful to be able to read the opinions of one of the most influential people
                        in the world on such a disruptive field. A person that has developed and worked on AI first hand and someone that has a high degree of control over its developments and a person
                        that has an ethical compass similar of mine. The book walks you through how technology modifies society and how this "wave" is similar and different to older ones. Mustafa doesn't just stop at contemplating
                        the change and the dangers but provides frameworks to manage the impact of these technologies, predicting how they might be used for good and for bad. One thing that i'll bring with me from this book is
                        awareness that not even the people in the front have a clear image of how wide this new advancement is, and that has probably always been true with big developments, and it will always be the case.
