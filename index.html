                <p class="project-description">
                    As a group we developed a tool that would use kubernetes to deploy a social media scraping application. It would collection people's opinions
                    and sentiment from Reddit and Mastodon as a recurring job on Kubernetes facilitated by Fission serverless functions. Then it would collect the data
                    in Elasticsearch to then perform sentiment analysis and generate insights. Our topic was about how Trump's Tariffs were perceived by the
                    Australian population.

                <p class="project-description">
                    As a student i would have like to have a calendar in which i could have a clear countdown of the days left to an exam. Friends had the same issue 
                    and we found ourselves often going back to a paper calendar in order to have clear colorful boxes to visualize the days left. So I decided to experiment 
                    with a simple react app that would do just that, to which i inserted an AI component to generate a simple study plan based on notes, to-dos and days left for the exam.
                    With it, i also experimented with Supabase Edge functions to provide a serverless architecture and i used the Gemini CLI tool for development.

                <div class="project-date">Aug 2025</div>
                <p class="project-description">
                    I like to read AI newsletters to get the latest news and advancements in the field, most of which often include or sponsor new and useful tools. I wanted to have
                    a place in which i could collect all of these tools and be able to look for them when needed. So i created this library, which runs a workflow automatically that
                    scrapes all those useful tools from newsletters, then categorizes them and performs google searches to define a grading of the tools based on what it can find online.
                    This way, people would have access to older and more recent tools with a description generated by AI of what each tool is useful for. The app also allows to leave a vote on
                    each tool based on the opinion of the community, which will become part of the final grading of each tool in the library.

                <p class="project-description">
                    Developed an algorithm to optimize university course scheduling, reducing conflicts by 40%. 
                    The solution uses constraint satisfaction techniques and includes a user-friendly interface 
                    for administrators to input constraints and view optimized schedules.
